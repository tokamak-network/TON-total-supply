## 🔥 2. Impact Assessment - Supply Reduction Factors

### Relative Impact Analysis
Our pie chart analysis reveals four distinct categories of supply impact:

#### Primary Factors (Temporary Reduction)
- **Staking (57.7% of reductions)**: Largest contributor to supply constraint
- **DAO Lock (42.2% of reductions)**: Significant governance fund allocation

#### Secondary Factors (Permanent Reduction)
- **Token Burning (5.0% of total reductions)**: One-time governance transition burn to resolve ownership ambiguity
- **Reduced Seignorage (0.4%)**: Policy-driven temporary reduction

### Economic Implications
1. **Supply Scarcity**: Only 13.2% of original supply actively circulating
2. **Network Security**: High staking ratio indicates strong validator participation
3. **Governance Maturity**: Large DAO treasury enables long-term sustainability

## 📈 3. Major Events Timeline Analysis

### Critical Network Milestones

#### Phase 1: Network Launch (August 2020 - March 2021)
- **Gradual Staking Adoption**: Monthly increases of 1-1.4M TON staked
- **Network Bootstrap**: Early validators joining the network
- **Supply Distribution**: Initial token allocation to stakeholders

#### Phase 2: Major Transformation (March 2021)
**The Triple Event - March 11, 2021:**
- 🔥 **Strategic Token Burn**: 2,077,627 TON permanently burned to resolve ownership ambiguity before DAO launch
- 🏛️ **DAO Establishment**: 17,500,000 TON locked in treasury for decentralized governance
- 📈 **Staking Surge**: 1,745,159 TON additional staking

*This date represents the most significant transformation in TON's history, establishing the network's mature governance and economic model.*

**Background of the Token Burn:**
The burn was conducted to address a governance transition challenge. Before DAO establishment, tokens accumulated in the DAO Vault (from 50% of inflation rewards) had unclear ownership - they belonged neither to the Tokamak Foundation nor to the not-yet-established DAO. To ensure transparent governance initiation, the team decided to permanently remove these ambiguous tokens, creating a clean slate for the new decentralized governance system.

#### Phase 3: Policy Refinement (May - November 2021)
- **PowerTON Rate Adjustment**: Reduction from 10% to 5%
- **Seignorage Optimization**: 178,112 TON in reduced rewards
- **Network Stabilization**: Consistent staking growth patterns

#### Phase 4: Mature Growth (2022 - 2025)
- **Steady Expansion**: Continued staking increases without major disruptions
- **Network Maturity**: Stable participation rates and minimal governance changes
- **Recent Activity**: July 2024 saw final major staking surge (1.9M TON)

### Event Impact Assessment
- **Economic Certainty**: Major structural changes concentrated in 2021
- **Predictable Growth**: Post-2021 shows consistent, manageable expansion
- **Policy Success**: PowerTON adjustment effectively managed network economics
