## üî• 2. Impact Assessment - Supply Reduction Factors

### Relative Impact Analysis
Our pie chart analysis reveals four distinct categories of supply impact:

#### Primary Factors (Temporary Reduction)
- **Staking (57.7% of reductions)**: Largest contributor to supply constraint
- **DAO Lock (42.2% of reductions)**: Significant governance fund allocation

#### Secondary Factors (Permanent Reduction)
- **Token Burning (5.0% of total reductions)**: Permanent deflationary mechanism
- **Reduced Seignorage (0.4%)**: Policy-driven temporary reduction

### Economic Implications
1. **Supply Scarcity**: Only 13.2% of original supply actively circulating
2. **Network Security**: High staking ratio indicates strong validator participation
3. **Governance Maturity**: Large DAO treasury enables long-term sustainability
4. **Deflationary Design**: Systematic token burning creates upward price pressure
